//! Supervisor CONTROL HTTP API (axum, contract §5). Bound on `[peer_ula]:8730`
//! in prod; tests bind a loopback addr and drive the router directly via
//! `tower::ServiceExt::oneshot`.
//!
//! Since the per-app-runner refactor (Task 2.6) the control plane drives the
//! runner [`Orchestrator`] instead of hosting apps in-process: `start` spawns a
//! detached `tabbify-runner` and waits until it is healthy; `stop` / `purge`
//! shut the runner down (and `purge` reclaims its cache) and forget it; `list` /
//! `get` read the live runner fleet (records + a quick control-socket health
//! probe). App traffic is served by the per-app runners on their own app-ULAs,
//! NOT here — there is no `/apps/<uuid>/*` route on the control port; an app's
//! ULA IS its address.
//!
//! Endpoints:
//! - `GET  /health`
//! - `GET  /v1/apps`
//! - `GET  /v1/apps/:uuid`
//! - `POST /v1/apps/:uuid/start`  (spawn a runner + wait healthy)
//! - `POST /v1/apps/:uuid/stop`   (shutdown the runner + forget)
//! - `POST /v1/apps/:uuid/purge`  (purge + shutdown the runner + forget + clear cache)
//! - `POST /v1/apps/:uuid/reset`  (clear crash-loop/backoff state + retry immediately)
//! - `POST /v1/apps/:uuid/deploy` (zero-downtime swap or cold spawn pinned to `ref`)
//! - `POST /v1/build`             (clone → build → push to mesh registry)
//!
//! ## Module layout
//! - [`handlers`] — every HTTP handler + the request DTOs (`DeployBody`, `BuildBody`)
//!   + small response/error helpers.
//! - [`dto`]      — response DTOs for `#[utoipa::path]` annotations.
